# Final year project

At the end of the competition, we hope you will look at the current practices in this Industry Revolution with a new perspective and help us explore improved solutions to address difficult challenges faced.

All Themes have two Stages:
# Stage 1: Preparing for Automation
Teams learn software, concepts and conduct experiments to get ready for implementing their solutions.

# Stage 2: Implementing the Theme
Selected Teams go on to implement their full-fledged solution conforming to the rules provided in the rulebook (Detailed Rulebook will be provided in Stage 2).
